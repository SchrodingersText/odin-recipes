    <h2>Soft &amp; fluffy bao, filled with delicious saute&eacute;ed mushrooms</h2>
    <p>These buns are a <em>pain in the buns</em> to make! But their fluffy, slightly chewy
      exterior and salty-savory mushroom filling make them well worth the effort.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <h4>Dough:</h4>  
    <ul>
      <li>300g all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>60g wheat starch</li>
      <li>50g sugar</li>
      <li>4g instant yeast</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp oil</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>180ml cold milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Mushroom filling:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>500g mushrooms of your choice</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic</li>
      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 green onion stem</li>
      <li>1/2 Tbsp corn starch</li>
      <li>(optional)1-2 hot peppers</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>Note that you'll want to prepare the filling first, and allow it enough time to cool before filling the bao.</p>

    <h4>Mushroom filling:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Chop mushies.</li>
      <li>Saut&eacute;e mushies with oil over medium heat, stirring often.</li>
      <li>When mushrooms have browned a bit, add in the green onion. Allow both mushrooms and onions to take on a bit more colour.</li>
      <li>Add in garlic and hot peppers if using, and saut&eacute;e for about a minute.</li>
      <li>Mix cornstarch and soy sauce, and add to pan. Turn off the heat and continue to stir until the sauce thickens (this shouldn't take long).</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Dough:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, add all dry ingredients and stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Add milk and oil to the dry ingredients, and mix until you get a rough dough. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel and let the dough hang out for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic (about 30 minutes by hand).</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 10 equally-sized portions, roll them flat, and fill them. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Filling and steaming:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Fill 'em.</li>
      <li>Proof 'em for an hour, or until the dough springs back slowly when you press a finger into it.</li>
      <li>FIll your bao-laden steamer with water, and place it over medium heat. Once the water reaches a simmer, set a timer for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat. Don't open the steamer lid, let the bao hang out for 3 minutes, this prevents them from deflating/wrinkling.</li>
      <li>Transfer bao to a wire rack to cool, then enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
