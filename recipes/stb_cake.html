    <h1>Strawberry Summer Cake</h1>

    <h2>A cake that's as pretty as it is tasty.</h2>
    <p>This is a delicious, easy to make cake that's great for using up strawberries on their last legs.  The edges of the vanilla cake crisp up, while the strawberries on top turn 
      jammy - it's <em>redonkulously</em> good. I find this cake tastes best after it's cooled completely- the strawberries in particular, taste better cool than they do warm- but that's just my preference. 
      Can be served by itself, or with a dollop of whipped cream.
